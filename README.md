- 👋 Hi, I’m Vrushabh Donge.
- 👀 I’m interested in Control systems specifically nonlinear and Electrical engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently working as PhD research scholar and working on scale-free data-driven reinforcement learning optimal control algorithms.
               Skilled in Matlab, System and Control, Microsoft tools, LaTeX, Python, PLC, Typhoon HIL, and Adobe tools. 
                As part of my project, I have worked on 1) Cooperative control, 
                 2) Stochastic and Deterministic systems, 
                 3) Different sampling methods used in statistical learning such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques, advanced learning algorithms such as                       mirror descent and natural gradient descent,  
                 4) Nonlinear analysis of chaotic systems, 
                 5) Multi-Agent systems, graphical games, game-theoretic systems
                 6) Adaptive dynamic programming, path integral, and reinforcement learning algorithms for optimal control,
                 7) Data-driven control, and Decomposition techniques for large-scale systems control.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on reinforcement learning implentation for control of real-world examples like electrical power system and drives.
